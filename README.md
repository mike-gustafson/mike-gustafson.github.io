Technologies Used:

    HTML
    JavaScript
    CSS

Installation Instructions:

    None! The best part is that this game is hosted entirely online! You don't need to
    do anything to play it other than go to URL_PLACEHOLDER

Approach Taken:

    The game is entirely done using HTML canvas and vanilla JavaScript.  Except for the pop-up 
    menu, all the lifting is done in the JavaScript files. There are no pre-rendered 
    graphics used to keep the experience as clean and smooth as possible.  Using strictly 
    canvas elements allowed for much more focus on the physics and gameplay during development 
    which should translate into a better user experience. Avoiding the use of pre-existing 
    game-dev libraries and sticking to vanilla JS helped practice and hone my abilities as a 
    developer.
